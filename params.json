{"name":"Libevfibers","tagline":"Small C fiber library","body":"# About libevfibers\r\nSmall C fiber library that uses libev based event loop and libcoro based coroutine context switching. As libcoro alone is barely enough to do something useful, this project aims at building a complete fiber api around it while leveraging libev's high performance and flexibility.\r\n\r\nAPI documentation for current master along with general description is located [here](http://lupus.github.io/libevfibers/docs/current/index.html).\r\n\r\n# Recent changes\r\n## 12 May 2013\r\nI've just released libevfibers 0.3.0!\r\n\r\nThis release contains important bugfixes and some useful features. Documentation for this release can be found [here](http://lupus.github.io/libevfibers/docs/v0.3.0/index.html). The list of changes follows:\r\n\r\n* Fiber names are now gettable/settable\r\n* Also a name is now an array, embedded into a fiber structure to simplify memory management.\r\n* Support for fiber-local storage\r\n* fbr_reclaim fixes. Now when a fiber is reclaimed, it's filtered out from the stack to make sure that fbr_yield will not ield to a reclaimed fiber. Also fbr_reclaim of self will now never return.\r\n* Switched fbr_need_log and fbr_set_log_level to static inline\r\n* Now passing real fiber stack size to coro_create\r\n* Added ``active'' flag to destructor. To support this I've also added static and dynamic initializers for a destructor structure.\r\n* Moved fbr_mutex, fbr_cond_var, fbr_buffer into public API to allow stack allocation of these structures which should result in some speedup.\r\n* Protected libev watchers with desctructors. Now when doing fbr_read a destructor is set before fbr_ev_wait that will stop the watcher in case fiber is reclaimed while we were waiting.\r\n* ev_now() timestamp in default logger\r\n* Fixed fbr_ev_wait_one behaviour to match documentation\r\n* Added missing call of destructors upon fiber reclaim\r\n* Added stack-allocatable destructor API\r\n* More rethinking and reworking of the event facility (see [701e067](https://github.com/Lupus/libevfibers/commit/701e0671c29ceaa75882ff25b7fd55a0462d5610))\r\n\r\n## 9 December 2012\r\nI've just released libevfibers 0.2.0!\r\n\r\nAPI has changed quite a lot from the previous release. Hopefully this API will be more stable and will not be changed that much in the future. Documentation for this release can be found [here](http://lupus.github.io/libevfibers/docs/v0.2.0/index.html). The list of changes follows:\r\n\r\n* Dropped \"call\" and \"multicall\" interfaces alltogether\r\n* Added fbr_ev_wait and corresponding machinery\r\n* Added transactional ring buffer\r\n* Implemented error subsystem with f_errno\r\n* Fixed ABA problem with reclaimed fibers\r\n* Added logging system\r\n* Added conditional variables\r\n* Minor utility additions to API\r\n* Unit tests","google":"UA-35569049-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
